# Intro to LAN
* Local Area Networks (LAN) 

## Topologies

### Star (Most Common)
* Indivdiually conntected via switch or hub
* Scalable, very easy to add devices
* More expensive
* Harder to trouble shoot, switches don't die often

### Bus 
* Tree topologies
* Devices using the same wire
* Hard to trouble shoot
* Easier, cost effective

### Ring
* Token topologies
* connected for a loop
* Sending data around the loop
* One cut of cord, breaks network, might be a mesh network

### Router
* Connects networks
* sit at edge of networks to bring in internet
* Routes them to different paths

### Switches
* Aggregate devices using ethernet
