# OSI Model
* How we send data to and from devices and the various stages

## 7. Application
* This could be through the GUI or DNS (domain name service) on how we access the data and send it

## 6. Presentation
* This is where the standardization of the data takes place to ensure the data meets a certain criteria, encrypting for example

## 5. Session
* Estbalish a session between devices so that we can send the data
* Sessions are unique and once broke we would have to start over

## 4. Transport: 

### TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
* Continuous sharing like a file or email
* Ensures all data is sent/received
* Must have a secure connection and can be effected by bottlenecks on the network (speeds)

### UDP: User datagram protocol
* Non continous share like streaming a video or music
* Does not ensure all data is sent and received

## 3. Network
* Routing and reasembly of data takes place
* Determing the most optimal path to do so

### Open Shortest Path First
### Routing Information Protocol

## 2. Data link
* Sending the data to actaul physical address of device

## 1. Physical
* The electrical signals used for connecting devices
