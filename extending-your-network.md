# Extending Your Network

## Port Forwarding Intro
* Intranet, those on the network being able to acccess a computer on the network, private ip address
* If admin wants info to accessible to public, they need to use port forwarding, have to use the public IP address

## Firewalls 101
* Device/software within a network to determine what traffic is allowed to enter and exit
  * Where is the traffic coming from?
  * Where is the traffic going to?
  * What port is the traffic for?
  * What protocol is the traffic using?
* Peform inspection to see where things are going
* Can be device or software
* They can be stateful or stateless
* Happens in layer 3, 4 of OSI Model

### Stateful Firewall
* Uses all information rather than inspecting an individual packet

### Stateless Firewall
* Uses a static set of rules to see if packets are allowed, indivdual packets
