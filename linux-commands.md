# Linux Commands I Learned
* `history`: gets a history of commands ran
* `nmap <ip>`: short for network map, can run to see what services are running (install via homebrew)

## Operator
* `&`: run programs in background of terminal
* `&&`: combine multiple commands together
* `>`: redirector
* `>>`: redirector but also appends
