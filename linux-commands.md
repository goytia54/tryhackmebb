# Linux Commands I Learned
* `file`: determine the type of a file
* `history`: gets a history of commands ran
* `nmap <ip>`: short for network map, can run to see what services are running (install via homebrew)
* `man` gives a manual on how to use a command

## Operators
* `&`: run programs in background of terminal
* `&&`: combine multiple commands together
* `>`: redirector
* `>>`: redirector but also appends
