# Linux 

## Commands I Learned
* `file`: determine the type of a file
* `history`: gets a history of commands ran
* `nmap <ip>`: short for network map, can run to see what services are running (install via homebrew)
* `man` gives a manual on how to use a command
* `wget` to fetch things from sites
* `python3 -m http.server` simple http server where you run and serve files from current directory

## Operators
* `&`: run programs in background of terminal
* `&&`: combine multiple commands together
* `>`: redirector
* `>>`: redirector but also appends

## Commone Directories
* `/etc`: common for system files by operating system
* `/var`: variable data, contains application logs
* `root`: home for root use
* `tmp`: short for temporary, volatile (good for pen testing as any user can write to this)
