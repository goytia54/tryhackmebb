* `fg`: bring process to fore ground
* `history`: gets a history of commands ran
* `kill <pid> found via ps aux`: kill a process 
* `nmap <ip>`: short for network map, can run to see what services are running (install via homebrew)
* `man` gives a manual on how to use a command
* `python3 -m http.server` simple http server where you run and serve files from current directory
* `ps`: process command
* `top`: get all the top running processes using memory and such
* `wget` to fetch things from sites

## Operators
* `&`: run programs in background of terminal
* `&&`: combine multiple commands together
* `>`: redirector
* `>>`: redirector but also appends

## Commone Directories
* `/etc`: common for system files by operating system
* `/var`: variable data, contains application logs
* `root`: home for root use
* `tmp`: short for temporary, volatile (good for pen testing as any user can write to this)
